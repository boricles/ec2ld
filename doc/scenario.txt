Finding semantic similarities 
 * people like to find virtual machine similar to their own
 * sometimes we want to replace physical machines with virtual machines 
 
Finding a suitable virtual machine to test software 
 * based on the software / hardware requirements 
 

In the case you want to find a machine similar to exisitng physical machine
 * run our tool inside the physical machine
 * it will collect information from the environment
   create a sparql query based on all available data
    - an algorithm to find the most suitable one in case it can't find all paramerters
    - define what are the must have and what are the optional
  * it will connect to our SPARQL endpoint and get the suitable images 
  * will show the ids

In the case you want to run a new software,
  * user has to put some values in a webapp which will show suitable AMI ids
